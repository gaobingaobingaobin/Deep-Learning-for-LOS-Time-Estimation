# Deep Learning for LOS Time Estimation
Apply deep learning approaches to terrestrial radio positioning to estimate the LOS time from any given channel profile with direct path (LOS component).

## Input:
The input is an array sized N*2, where N is the number of channel taps captured. For each channel tap, its delay (appearance time) and magnitude is recorded (thus, 2 features are captured).
The input is a matrix of non-negative real-valued numbers.


The source codes will be make public after acceptance of the paper.
